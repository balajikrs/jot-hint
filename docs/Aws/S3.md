# Simple Storage Service (S3)

- Object storage
- Global storage platform - regional based/resilient (data is stored in a specific aws region at rest)
  :::tip Imp
  Public service - runs in Aws public zone - unlimited - multiuser - 
  can tolerate a failure of a AZ and has few replication abilities
  :::
- Economical and accessed by
  - HTTP
  - API
  - GUI
  - CLI
- Delivers Objects and buckets

# Objects and buckets

- object has a key - that Obj can be referenced using a key in a bucket
- by default none has access to a public bucket except the root user
- Value - content being stored / binary data of the images or videos
- object can be between 0 byte and 5 terabytes
- object has
  - version id
  - metadata
  - Access control
  - subresouces
- Buckets
  - created in specific aws region - data never leaves a region unless we do so
  - name should be globally unique
  - S3 has stable data sovereignty
  - Blast radius is a region
  - Buckets can have unlimited number of objects
  - Flat structure - all objects are stored at same level
  - 3 - 63 characters - all lowercase no underscores
  - starts with lowercase or number
  - cannot be formated as ip address like 1.1.1.1
  - soft limit 100 buckets for an account ; 1000 is hard limit per account
  - key is the name value is the data
  - folder like stuctures are just prefixes
  - cannot mount in linux or windows as they are not file or block storage
  - 1 EBS can be attached to one instance but s3 we can do multi access
  - great for offload in things
  - great for large scale data storage, distribution or upload
  - default for any input or output aws products
